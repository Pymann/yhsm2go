# yubihsm2
This repository is a golang wrapper of yubihsm2 library from yubico.com, it's not complete yet.

But basic functionality is available.

Just install the libraries from yubico: https://developers.yubico.com/YubiHSM2/Releases/
I recommend to take the latest release.

Then you can go install github.com/Pymann/yubihsm2/do_stuff and run compiled binary 'do_stuff' in your <GOPATH>/bin - folder.
This binary will perform a test for the golang wrapper and prove its working.
